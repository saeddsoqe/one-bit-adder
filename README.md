# one-bit-adder
full adder 
it consistes of three inputs and two outputs 
input1 
input2
cin (for the previous carrier or to initialize the adder and its equal zero)
sum (the summation output)
carrier (carrier output terminal )
 sum equation is 
 input1 XOR input2 XOR cin
 carrier equation is 
 (input1 AND input2) OR ((input1 XOR input2) AND cin)
